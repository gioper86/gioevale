										<h3>Calabria</h3>
									</header>
                                    <h4>Scilla</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        <b>Scilla</b> is a nice town on the coast only 20 minutes drive from Palmi. The main attractions here are the castle,
                                        the nice city centre and the beach. Our favourite part of Scilla is a picturesque village called <b>Chianalea</b>. 
                                        Its houses almost built on the water, the narrow streets and the amazing restaurants make it a must-see place.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Reggio Calabria</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        <b>Reggio Calabria</b> is the capital of the province and the biggest city nearby Palmi, but still not that big. 
                                        It’s just 30 minutes away from Palmi (by car). Its sea-side has been elected "the most beautiful kilometer" in Italy. 
                                        Sicily seems just a swim away from there and the view on the volcano Etna is often spectacular. 
                                        The main street (Corso Garibaldi) is the shopping area. Reggio is great for food, it has nice restaurants, amazing ice-cream (like this place) and “pasticcerie”. 
                                        Reggio also has an incredible history and its museum is a must-see. The famous “Bronzi di Riace” are exposed there.
                                    </p>                                      
                                    <h4>Tropea</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        <b>Tropea</b> is one of the most popular holiday destinations in Calabria. The town is very pretty and its beaches stunning. 
                                        Another location to be visited nearby is <b>Capo Vaticano</b>. 
                                        There you’ll find some of the best beaches in Calabria. 
                                        Tropea is roughly an hour drive from Palmi.

										<h3>Sicily</h3>
									</header>
								    <p> 
                                        Sicily is easily reachable from Palmi. To get there by car the best way is to go to Villa San Giovanni and then take the ferry. 
                                        The whole journey (ferry included) takes just more than an hour. 
                                        The ticket for the ferry when going by car is around 45€ return (within 3 days).
                                        Sicily is a big island, in fact, the biggest of the Mediterranean. Here we only suggest a few places in the eastern part of Sicily 
                                        that are relatively close to Palmi. If you want to know more ask us :) <a href="http://www.visitsicily.info/en/" target="_blank">This website </a> is also good.

                                    <h4>Taormina</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Taormina is a stunning small town and very popular tourist destinations in Sicily. 
                                        It’s just 30 minutes drive from Messina (other side of the strait).

                                    <p>
                                        I'm sure you've heard of it. It's the biggest Volcano in Europe. <a href=" http://www.visitsicily.info/en/mount-etna/" target="_blank">Find out more about it here.</a>

                                    <h4>Catania</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Catania is the second largest metropolitan city of Sicily. Over the centuries, it has faced earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, it has undergone alternating dominations and urban transformations.

                                    <h4>Siracusa</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Siracusa is one of our favourite places in the whole of Italy. 
                                        I would say that from an historical point of view is one of the most important cities in the Mediterranean area. 
                                        Apart from the history, it’s just a beautiful place. <a href="http://www.visitsicily.info/en/10cosea/siracusa/" target="_blank">Find out more here</a>.
                                    </p>  
                                    <h4>Aeolian Islands</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        It's an archipelago composed of 7 stunning islands, 2 of which are active volcanoes (Stromboli and Vulcano).
                                        Even though they are very close (and visible) to Palmi, getting there is not extremely easy. Ask us if you’d like to have more info.
